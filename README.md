# Filmood

**Tell Filmood how you want to feel. It tells you what to watch — alone or as a group.**

🔗 **Live demo:** [filmood-pi.vercel.app](https://filmood-pi.vercel.app/)

Filmood is a film discovery and decision-making web app that starts from the user's emotional state rather than from content catalogs. Users pick a mood, and Filmood returns films that match it. The app supports both solo discovery and a real-time group session where several people swipe on a shared film deck and the app picks a winner based on everyone's votes.

## Features

### Solo experience

- **Mood-based discovery.** Pick one or more moods (laugh, escape, cry, thrilling, thoughtful, and six more) and get a curated film list from TMDB. Refine by runtime, language, or excluded genres.
- **Search and browse.** Search films by title, actor, or director. Browse by category (trending, top rated, new releases, in cinemas, by genre, streaming in Norway).
- **Film details.** Full cast, Norwegian streaming providers, YouTube trailer, overview, and metadata for every film.
- **Watchlist.** Save films to a personal watchlist (w.i.p.).
- **Guest-friendly.** Everything except the watchlist works without an account. A gentle prompt appears when a feature needs one.

### Group sessions

- **Create a session.** One person (the host) creates a session and shares a 6-character code.
- **Join with a nickname.** Guests can join without creating an account.
- **Private mood selection.** Each participant picks their moods in private. The app merges everyone's picks into a balanced 15-film deck.
- **Swipe deck.** Everyone swipes yes / no / maybe on the shared deck with real-time updates via Supabase Realtime.
- **Ranked results.** The app aggregates votes into three tiers — Perfect Match, Strong Contenders, and Not Tonight — and picks a Top Pick.

### Design

- **Dual theme.** Full dark and light themes built on CSS custom properties. The theme toggle is accessible and hydration-safe.
- **Responsive.** Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile with a bottom-sheet pattern on small screens.
- **v9 design system.** Lora (serif) for headings, Plus Jakarta Sans for body. Six accent color families map to moods and phases of the app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher (Next.js 16 dropped Node 18 support)
- npm
- A [TMDB API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) (free)
- A [Supabase project](https://supabase.com) (free tier)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tubhaahmad/filmood.git
cd filmood
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values. The `.env.local` file is gitignored and must never be committed.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The required variables are:

```env
# Supabase — get these from your Supabase project settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# TMDB — get this from themoviedb.org/settings/api
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
```

### Database setup

Run the SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` against your Supabase project in order:

1. `000_watchlists.sql` — watchlists table
2. `001_group_sessions.sql` — sessions, session_participants, swipes tables with RLS and Realtime
3. `002_add_is_ready.sql` — adds `is_ready` flag to session_participants
4. `003_mood_refinements.sql` — adds `mood_text`, `era`, `tempo`, `extra_keywords` to session_participants

Run them in the Supabase SQL Editor or via the Supabase CLI. An optional `supabase/seed_group_session.sql` file is included with sample data for testing the group flow locally.

### E2E test user (optional, only if you plan to run Playwright)

The Playwright suite logs in as a dedicated Supabase user. To provision it, copy the template and run the seed script:

```bash
cp .env.test.example .env.test.local
# Edit .env.test.local and pick a strong password
npm run seed:e2e-user
```

The seed script is idempotent — running it again when the user already exists is a no-op. `.env.test.local` is gitignored and must never be committed.

### Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server on localhost:3000
npm run build            # Production build
npm run start            # Start production server
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix         # Auto-fix lint issues

# Unit and component tests (Vitest)
npm test                 # Run all Vitest suites once
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode

# End-to-end tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e         # Run Playwright suite (boots dev server automatically)
npm run test:e2e:ui      # Playwright UI mode
npm run test:e2e:debug   # Debug mode with inspector

# One-off setup
npm run seed:e2e-user    # Provision the Supabase user used by the E2E suite
```

## Deploying to Vercel

The app is a standard Next.js 16 project and deploys to Vercel without custom build steps. Import the repo in the Vercel dashboard, then configure:

### Environment variables (Production + Preview)

Set these under **Settings → Environment Variables**:

| Variable | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Same value as local. Exposed to the client. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Same value as local. Exposed to the client. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-only. Used by admin routes and the E2E seed script. Never expose. |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | Server-only. Used by `/api/movies/*` route handlers. |

### Supabase configuration

Set **Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → Site URL** to the production Vercel domain so email-confirmation links sent during signup resolve correctly. If you later enable OAuth providers or magic-link auth, also add preview/production domains under **Redirect URLs**.

### Database

Make sure all four migrations in `supabase/migrations/` have been applied to the Supabase project used by production. New migrations must be applied manually in the Supabase SQL Editor before deploying code that depends on them.

### Node version

The repo pins Node 20 via `.nvmrc`, which Vercel reads for both the build and function runtime. `package.json` also declares `engines.node: ">=20"` for npm's benefit.

### Troubleshooting

**Build fails with `Error: supabaseUrl is required.` during prerender of `/_not-found`.** The Supabase env vars aren't set (or weren't set at the time the build started). `lib/supabase.ts` constructs the client at module load, and Next's static prerender imports it via `AuthProvider`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for **all three** environments (Production, Preview, Development) and redeploy — env changes only apply to new builds.

## Architecture Notes

**Authentication runs through Supabase directly.** `AuthProvider` wraps the app in React Context and listens to `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange`. For API requests, components use `getAuthHeaders()` from `lib/getAuthToken.ts` which calls `supabase.auth.getSession()` at request time to get a fresh JWT — never reading the token from React state, which can hold stale values after Supabase auto-refreshes.

**Group sessions support guest participants.** Most `/api/group/[code]/*` routes are auth-optional. Guests identify themselves with a `participantId` stored in `localStorage`. Authenticated users identify themselves with a Supabase JWT in the `Authorization` header. The shared helpers `resolveSession()` and `resolveParticipant()` in `lib/group-api.ts` handle both paths.

**Realtime with a polling fallback.** The `useGroupRealtime` hook subscribes to Supabase `postgres_changes` on sessions, participants, and swipes. It also polls every 2 seconds as a safety net for unreliable connections. Callbacks are stored in refs so subscriptions don't thrash on every render.

**Optimistic voting.** When a user swipes on a card, the vote is applied to local state immediately. If the POST fails, the vote is retried once after 800ms rather than rolled back — the card is already visually gone and reverting would be jarring. A `Math.max` guard on the card index prevents polling from snapping the deck backwards.

**TMDB API key never reaches the client.** All TMDB calls go through `/api/movies/*` route handlers on the server. The client only ever talks to our own API.

**Tailwind v4 layer workaround.** Custom CSS classes for layout are unreliable in Tailwind v4 production builds because of how layer specificity works. Layout-critical styles use inline `style={}` props, and `useMediaQuery` (hydration-safe) handles responsive breakpoints. CSS classes are reserved for animations and hide/show toggles.
